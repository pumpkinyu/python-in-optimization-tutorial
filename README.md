Introduction
--------
This tutorial is constructed for readers who are both beginners of python and mathematical optimization. Although reading both the book and source code is recommended for clearer understanding, only the source code could be used for a fast overview, as the key knowledge for each task is built in it.

Both English and Chinease version will be provided in the future.
